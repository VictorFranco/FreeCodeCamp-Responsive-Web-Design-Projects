Born
Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912 in Maida Vale, London.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Aug 19, 1926</span>
Early Signs of Intelligence
At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs of intelligence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Aug 29, 1931</span>
Getting Serious About Technology
Alan Turing studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Sep 30, 1936</span>
Studied at Princeton University
Turing studied mathematics and cryptology while also building three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at Princeton University.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Dec 6, 1939</span>
Hut 8
Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Mar 18, 1940</span>
Bombe
Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Nov 29, 1942</span>
Travels to US
Turing traveled to the United States to work with the US naval cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Feb 19, 1946</span>
Presented Paper
He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had presented the first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Sep 13, 1947</span>
ACE
Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).</li>
          <li><span class="time">Mar 19, 1948</span>
LU decomposition method
Turing created the LU decomposition method that was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Aug 31, 1948</span>
Software for stored-program computers
Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics department at the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Apr 29, 1950</span>
Turing Test
The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Jan 29, 1952</span>
Indecency
Turing was caught in a relationship with an unemployed 19 year old man. He was convicted for indecency because homosexual acts were considered criminal offences in the United Kingdom at the time. This is what lead to his downhill spiral right before his suicide.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Jan 29, 1952</span>
Book Published
Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" was published in 1952 which was all about his interest in the biology of organisms.</li>
          <li><span class="time">Jun 8, 1954</span>
Death
Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him dead.</li>
